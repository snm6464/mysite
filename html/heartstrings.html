                                <li>i made a paper prototype of a sensor with a voltage divider and velostat in the middle</li>
                                <li>i realized it would be difficult to measure a universal on/off state with this method, which is what i wanted</li>
                                <li>i decided to create more of a button-like sensor with copper tape and foam in the middle</li>
                                <li>i tested out cutting holes in the foam and made sure an on/off state could be achieved</li>
                                <li>i created the final form of the sensor: a fabric sleeve with foam in the middle, lined with copper tape for flexibility, conductivity, and resilience</li>

                        I’m incredibly happy with how this piece turned out. It worked exactly how I wanted to and, while it took a slightly different form than what I had envisioned, I still feel as though the piece represented myself and my journey in the way I intended it to. It was incredibly fulfilling to see that people not only enjoyed interacting with the piece, but many people actually immersed themselves in the piece by sitting in the furniture and truly taking it in. I am also incredibly satisfied with the fact that the piece evoked emotion and memories for many onlookers.
                        I would prbably have sourced more material to recreate a living room setting. It would have been nice to have a lamp or other types of lighting to create more of an ambiance. Additionally, I’d have made more pieces, possibly even more textile pieces that could have been used on the walls. I don’t think I’d change what I created, however.
                        I envision this project being a possible thesis exploration with more time to explore textile types, weaving techniques, etc. I hope to make this a greater, larger project in the future and explore my relationship to my culture as I grow and develop as an adult! <br>
